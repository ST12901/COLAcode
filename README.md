    This is COLAcode: a serial particle mesh-based N-body code 
     illustrating the COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration) method 
     described in S. Tassev, M. Zaldarriaga, D. Eisenstein (2012).
     Check that paper for the details.
     
    If you use the COLA method or COLAcode for scientific work, we kindly ask you 
    to reference the paper above.
    
    * To compile the code, one needs the GSL and FFTW-3 libraries.
    * Run "make" to compile. 
    * Run "./COLAcode" to run the code.
    * See the text at the top of main.c for a description of the input 
    and output of the code.
